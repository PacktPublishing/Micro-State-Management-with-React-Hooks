This is the code repository for [Micro State Management with React Hooks](https://www.packtpub.com/product/micro-state-management-with-react-hooks/9781801812375), published by Packt.

**Explore custom hooks libraries like Zustand, Jotai, and Valtio to manage global states**

## What is this book about?
State management is one of the most complex concepts in React. Traditionally, developers have used monolithic state management solutions. Thanks to React Hooks, micro state management is something tuned for moving your application from a monolith to a microservice.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand micro state management and how you can deal with global state
* Build libraries using micro state management along with React Hooks
* Discover how micro approaches are easy using React Hooks
* Understand the difference between component state and module state
* Explore several approaches for implementing a global state

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>
        +1
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

```
